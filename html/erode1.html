    <td><p>History of Erode
        Erode was a part of Coimbatore and the history of Erode is thus very closely linked with the history of Coimbatore. The total area of Erode and Coimbatore formed the ancient “Kongu” country which was also known as the “Kongu Nadu”. The history of Kongu Nadu goes back to the Sangam Era. In the early days, the regions were occupied by tribes like “Kosars”, whom the Rashtrakuta rulers defeated to set foot in the region.  The capital of the Kosars was ‘Kosamputhur’ or the modern day ‘Coimbatore’.  Chola rulers defeated the Rashtrakutas to set foot in Kongu and during the time of Raja Chola, it reached the height of supremacy. Later this area was controlled by Chalukya, Pandyas and Hoysalas. Kulasekara Pandian was the last independent Pandya ruler and then Erode came under the rule of the Muslim rulers of Delhi. But, only after a few days, the Vijayanagar Kingdom gained the control of Erode in 1378 CE. The Madurai Nayaks ruled Erode from 1559 to 1736. The Mysore Rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan also ruled Erode.
        
        During the time of Hydar Ali, Erode had an estimated population of 1500 and there were 300 houses in the town. The town also had a mud fort which stationed a garrison of 4000 soldiers. The fort was surrounded by coconut grooves and River Kauvery. Due to the attacks by the Marathas, Mysore Army and finally the British East India Company, the fort was almost ruined.
